## Supported languages

You're currently on the `index` branch.
Since we're implementing Pawnote in different languages, we have a branch for each language.

- [JavaScript / TypeScript](https://github.com/LiterateInk/Pawnote/tree/js) (base implementation)
- [Dart](https://github.com/LiterateInk/Pawnote/tree/dart) (work in progress)

## Documentation

For now, since we're still in the early stages of development, the documentation is not available yet.

You might go look at the examples for the language you want to use for now.

## Resources

Without these very useful resources, I wouldn't be able to write Pawnote by myself.

- [Pronote Protocol](https://github.com/bain3/pronotepy/blob/master/PRONOTE%20protocol.md) written by developers of `pronotepy`.
- [`pronote-api`](https://github.com/Merlode11/pronote-api)'s (forked) source code.
- [`pronotepy`](https://github.com/bain3/pronotepy)'s source code.
